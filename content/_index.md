> Hackberry, celtis occidentalis, is one of the worst named and least appreciated trees. They are truly magnificent full sized canopy trees that grace the forests of the Northeast and the world. The fruit they produce in copious amounts is bar none excellent wildlife feed. Hackberry's bizarre bark alone makes it worth growing, but there is so much more to these resilient native trees.
